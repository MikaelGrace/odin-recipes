            <li>Baking powder</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix: </strong>Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl and your wet ingredients 
                (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, 
                then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy. </li>

                Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another few minutes (or until each side is golden brown).</li>
            <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with your favorite pancake toppings.</li>
